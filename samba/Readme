$ docker run -v /vol001 --name vo1001_ busybox true      

launch samba to publish the volume by refering its container
$ docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock  njhsi/samba vo1001_  

mount the samba share onto OS X host (using Docker for Mac beta. replace the 'localhost' with dockerIP if using docker toolbox)
$ mount_smbfs //guest@localhost:/vol001 ./vol001
